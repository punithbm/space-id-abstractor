### _Powering Token Bound Accounts with Space IDs_

---

## **Overview:**

Interstellar enhances the utility of Space IDs by enabling them to function as ERC 6551 token bound accounts.
Deployed on both the Arbitrum and BSC chains, this helps Space ID holders to not only manage and trade their IDs but also to harness them for transactions and token storage, much like they would with an EOA account.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Wallet Connection:** Users initiate the process by connecting their wallets.
2. **Space ID Verification:** The application checks the connected wallet for any associated Space IDs.
3. **Space ID Registration:** If no Space IDs are found linked to the wallet, users are prompted to register for a Space ID.
4. **Space ID Login:** For users with registered Space IDs, they are asked to log into their Space IDs.
5. **Deployment of Token Bound Account:** Upon successful login, users have the capability to deploy a token bound account from their Space ID NFT.
6. **Token Holding & Transactions:** Once the account is deployed, users can hold tokens and conduct transactions with the utility and flexibility akin to an EOA account.

## **Benefits & Impact:**

- **Enhanced Utility:** While the current Space ID platform mainly allows for the trading and management of IDs, Interstellar significantly augments the functionality by enabling the creation of wallets, which inherently boost the potential and usability of Space IDs.

- **Broadened Usability:** Users can employ their Space ID much like any other EOA account, which streamlines processes and offers a seamless user experience.

## **Future Outlook:**

As the cryptocurrency and NFT space continue to evolve, tools that enhance the functionality of existing assets will be paramount. Interstellar is positioned at the forefront of this movement, providing users with a unique, value-added proposition for their Space IDs. Further developments can include advanced security features, integration with other blockchain platforms, and broadening the ecosystem of utilities and services centered around Space IDs.
